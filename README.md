## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Q: The security indicator shows yellow/warning**  
A: Some security features may not be fully active. Check that you're using a modern browser and the file wasn't modified.

**Q: Dates aren't calculating correctly**  
A: Ensure your Research Start Date is set correctly. All dates cascade from this baseline.

**Q: Print layout looks wrong**  
A: Make sure you're in View Mode and using landscape orientation in your print settings.

**Q: Can't import my JSON file**  
A: Verify the file is valid JSON and under 10MB. Check the debug console for specific error messages.

### **Debug Console**

- Security event monitoring
- Data validation status
- Performance metrics
- Error debugging information
